## Strategy

The user's strategy involves calculating the perimeter of a rectangle based on
its length and width. They utilize the formula `2 * (length + width)`
to compute the perimeter. This strategy is straightforward and relies on basic
arithmetic operations.

## Implementation

The user implemented the solution using a function named `findPerimeter`.
This function takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, representing the
dimensions of the rectangle. Inside the function, they calculate the perimeter
using the provided formula and return the result. The implementation is concise
and does not involve complex algorithms.

## Possible Refactors

- **Parameter Validation**: Adding parameter validation to ensure both `length`
  and `width` are non-negative numbers could enhance the robustness of the function.
- **Decomposition**: Breaking down the function into smaller, more reusable parts
  could improve readability and maintainability, especially if additional
  calculations are needed in the future.
- **Optional Parameters**: Considering the case where only one dimension
  (length or width) is provided and inferring the missing dimension could make
   the function more versatile.
